# 🌟 Welcome to Anishk's GIT Page 🌟

Hey there! 👋 I’m **Anish Kadam** — a blockchain dev, JavaScript wizard-in-training, and part-time debugger of bugs (that I probably created).

If you're into smart contracts, Web3 magic, and the occasional coffee-fueled all-nighter, you're in the right place.

## 👨‍💻 About Me

- Master’s in Blockchain Tech  
- Dev at **TecMetaverse**  
- Fluent in Solidity, JS, MERN, Ethereum, Solana, and sarcasm  
- I live with a supportive co-dev — my doggo 🐶

I design UIs, build dApps, write smart contracts, break stuff, fix it (sometimes), and drink way too much coffee.

## 🎭 Bonus Joke  

*Vitalik created Ethereum to decentralize the world.*  
*Charles wanted to centralize the philosophy behind it.*  
**So Vitalik did the most decentralized thing possible…**  
> He **forked Charles out like expired code.**

Now one runs **Ethereum** — bloated, overhyped, but alive.  
The other runs **Cardano** — pristine, peer-reviewed,  
> **...and used mostly by YouTubers selling hopium.** 💀

*Some say if you run a full Cardano node backwards under a blood moon,  
it still won’t have working smart contracts.* 🫠
