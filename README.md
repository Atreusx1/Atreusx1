# 🌟 Anishk's Portfolio Website 🌟

Hey there! 👋 Welcome to my portfolio. I’m **Anish Kadam** — a blockchain enthusiast, JavaScript wizard-in-training, and part-time debugger of mysterious bugs (that I probably wrote myself).

If you're looking for someone who lives and breathes smart contracts, Web3 magic, and the occasional late-night coffee-fueled deployment, you're in the right place.

> 🌐 Experience the magic of my portfolio live on **Vercel**. It’s pixel-perfect (most of the time) and runs smoother than my last cup of coffee.

## 🚀 About Me

### 👨‍💻 Who Am I?

I’m a Computer Science graduate with a Master’s in Blockchain Technology. Currently building cool stuff at **TecMetaverse**, where I play around with Solana, MONAD, MERN, and more buzzwords than I can keep track of. I love turning complex ideas into sleek, functional applications — even if I break a few things along the way (don’t worry, I fix them. Eventually).

I also live with a fluffy co-developer — my doggo 🐶. He’s great at moral support, not so much at debugging.

### ⚙️ What Do I Do?

- Write code (obviously)
- Design UIs that don’t make you cry
- Build dApps that *probably* work
- Break things and Google the fix
- Drink too much coffee and pretend that’s normal

## 🛠️ Skills

I *think* I'm pretty good at these things. But let’s be honest, half the battle is pretending you know what you're doing:

### 🧠 Programming Languages

- 🟨 **JavaScript** (MERN Stack survivor)
- 🐍 **Python** (APIs, scripting)
- 💻 **C** (Because we all started somewhere)
- 🧾 **Solidity** (Smart contracts that mostly don’t explode)
- 🦀 **Rust** (Used for Solana adventures)
- 🐹 **Go** (Still taming the gopher)

### 🧰 Frameworks & Libraries

- ⚛️ **React.js** (We’re in a love-hate relationship)
- 🧭 **Next.js**, 🧪 **Vite**, 🍃 **Vue.js** (Can switch to them like a true shapeshifter)
- 🌐 **Node.js** + Express.js (Where backend meets chaos)
- 🕸️ **Django** (When I want to feel professional)
- 🧠 **Three.js** (Basic 3D scene wizardry)
- 📦 React Production Optimization (Custom scripts and tweaks to squeeze every bit of performance)
- 🔌 **Web3.js / Ethers.js** (Talking to chains like a magician)

### 🧪 Testing & Security Tools

- 🐍 **Slither** (Static analysis for Solidity — my bug-sniffing hound)
- 🔧 **Chai / Mocha** (For when I need to test the test of the test)
- 🧠 **Hardhat / Truffle test suites** (Because things break… a lot)
- 🧪 Foundry – Fast, gas-optimized testing (when Hardhat needs a rival)
- 🧑‍🔬 Remix IDE – Testing and deploying contracts with less setup (and more clicking)

### ☁️ DevOps & Deployment

- 🖥️ **AWS Console** (I’ve clicked buttons that matter)
- 📦 **S3 & Amplify** (Static site deployment like a pro)
- ⚙️ **Lambda** (Written APIs with just the right dose of serverless chaos)
- 💻 **EC2** (Launched, configured, probably panicked once or twice)

### 🔗 Blockchain & Web3

- 🔐 **Smart Contracts** (ERC-20/721/1155... yep, all those numbers)
- 💸 **DeFi, NFTs, DAOs** — I’ve built and broken a few
- ⚙️ **Solana, MONAD, Ethereum, BSC, Polygon** (L1 & L2 fun)
- 🧱 **Hyperledger Fabric** (Because enterprise still matters and it's boring)

### 🧠 Bonus Skill

- 🔍 Expert in staring at code until it works
- 🐶 Trained to blame the doggo when bugs appear

## 📱 Projects

### 🔒 Cool Project #1 - Decentralized Voting System
Built a secure, transparent blockchain-based voting platform. Not guaranteed to survive a nation-state attack, but hey — it works and looks cool!

### 🎨 Cool Project #2 - NFT Marketplace
A place to mint, buy, and sell NFTs. No apes were harmed in the making of this project. You could call it art, or just a really complex shopping site.

### 🧪 Secret Project
Let’s just say… it’s on the blockchain. It might be groundbreaking, or it might be another over-engineered to-do app. You’ll have to wait and see.

## 🎉 Why This Website?

Because shouting "I'm a blockchain dev!" into the void wasn’t enough. I wanted a space to showcase my skills, side-projects, and very questionable sense of humor. Also, my mom thinks this is cool.

## 📝 Disclaimer

This site is a work in progress (like most of my life). If something breaks, it's probably:
- The internet’s fault
- My cat’s fault (or let’s say, *doggo*)
- Or a feature, not a bug 😉

## *Disclaimer: I might be boasting a little... but hey, confidence counts, right?*


Thanks for stopping by! 🙌
